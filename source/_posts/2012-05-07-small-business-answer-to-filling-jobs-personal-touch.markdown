Say you want to hire for a new position. Do you count on interviews alone to make hiring decisions? Does your company have an obsession with grades?

According to [a research](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/10/selecting-talent-the-upshot-from-85-years-of-research.html) by Frank Schmidt and John Hunter in the Psychological Bulletin, interviews are not the best predictor of performance, despite their widespread use. 

Big corporations, like Google, would [collect and analyze data](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/technology/03google.html?_r=1) about their existing employees and come up with some sophisticated models to evaluate and identify top talents. Unfortunately,  as a small business, you probably don't have a large data set and the skills to build such a statistical model. So does that mean you should give up and compromise your hiring standards?

So if you're trying to compete with companies that are much bigger and better funded, you're not going to win by playing their games. You have to think differently. So what can you do to attract superstar candidates to come to you?

In a world of technology innovations, hiring managers are often too busy to give superstar candidates the "personal touch" they crave. They tend to rely too much on technology, mostly sending out impersonal emails, and forget that this is a people business. People like to be touched, talked to personally, courted, and wooed.

Recruiting technology can help, but it can only take you so far. And it definitely is not a silver bullet because hiring is still a highly personal activity. Many companies hate adding the "personal touch" in the hiring process because it takes time and perseverance. 

So if you find top talent candidate, your company has to be willing to invest more than just money because you  can’t compete based on wages, or equity alone nowadays. You need to make sure that they know you value their talent.

One of the classic examples is how 42Floors, a startup trying to disrupt the commercial real estate market, decided to publicly offer the sophomore a job via their company blog.
