We're committed to delivering a great product that continues to evolve with new features and benefits. Therefore, we are changing our plan offerings in response to our customer requests for different packaging and features. 
 
We will continue to offer a Free plan. However, the **Visionary plan** is discontinued and replaced with the new Standard, Plus and Premium plans.

Below are the new plans and pricing:

**Free Plan**: 1 user, 1 job, unlimited resumes
**Standard Plan ($29/mth)**: 1 user, 3 jobs, unlimited resumes
**Plus Plan ($49/mth)**: 10 user, 10 jobs, unlimited resumes
**Premium Plan ($99/mth)**: 50 users, unlimited jobs, unlimited resumes

What if I was using the Visionary Plan?

To show our appreciation for support, we are now offering an exclusive offer to all of our existing customers. **You can enjoy our Premium Plan for $29/month (Original price: $99/month) - without a time limit! **

Please go to the link below to choose your plan now:

If you were using our **Free Plan** and would like to remain so, no further action is needed.

We hope these changes enable us to continuously provide a high level of service to all customers, and really appreciate your ongoing business and feedback. 

If you have any questions, please contact [support@resumetracker.com](mailto:support@resumetracker.com). Thanks again for using Resume Tracker.
