Many small businesses believe that hiring is a top-down process driven by the owner. They wrongly assume that employees are happy to leave the hiring decision to the management. However, this approach often left team members feeling disconnected and frustrated. After all, they are the ones who will work with new hires on a daily basis. They should be the ideal people to judge whether the job candidate fits the company culture and values.

But how can business effectively involves their employees in the hiring process? Simply put, they have to embrace a collaborative hiring approach. 

It's common for big corporations like Google, Facebook, Apple…etc, to let job candidates to meet with their future colleagues during on-site interviews. Why do they do that? Because they understand the huge cost of making a bad hiring decision. According to the Department of Labor, the cost of mis-hire is considered to be, on average, 3-4 times their annual salary. It can be even higher at a smaller company when you have only a few or even one employee.

Including existing employees in the hiring process can make sure the candidates fit with the company's culture. In result, employers can make better hiring decisions and create a more productive and engaged workforce.

So how can small business learn to implement a collaborative hiring process? Simple steps like improving communication during the interview process can already create better and faster results.
